<h2 align="center">Install & Compile</h2>

For you to compile **wprecon** you will need to have the golang compiler installed.
And for that you will access the official website of golang and will download and install it. [**Here!**](https://golang.org/dl/)

Once downloaded and installed you will download **wprecon** directly from github with the command:
###### **(There are two ways to do this, and I will teach both.)**
1. Primary way:
- `go get -u github.com/blackcrw/wprecon`;

2. Second way:
- `mkdir ~/Go/src/github.com/blackcrw/wprecon`;
- `cd ~/Go/src/github.com/blackcrw`;
- `git clone https://github.com/blackcrw/wprecon`;
- `go get wprecon`.

After downloading **wprecon** you will compile with the command:
###### **(There are already some ways to do this ... but I'll show you the simplest and quickest.)**
- `go build ~/Go/src/blackcrw/github.com/blackcrw/wprecon`.

### ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ Ready!!! Your **wprecon** is compiled, now just start using it. It was pretty easy, right ?!
